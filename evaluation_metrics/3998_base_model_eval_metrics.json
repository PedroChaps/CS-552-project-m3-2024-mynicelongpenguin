This makes fluorine very reactive.\n\n### ANSWER\nB","expected":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful EPFL chatbot.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n### QUESTION\nWhat does fluorine attract better than any other element?\n\n###OPTIONS\nA: electron shells\nB: shared electrons\nC: magnets\nD: ionic bonds\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n### EXPLANATION\nValence electrons of both atoms are always involved when those two atoms come together to form a chemical bond. Chemical bonds are the basis for how elements combine with one another to form compounds. When these chemical bonds form, atoms of some elements have a greater ability to attract the valence electrons involved in the bond than other elements. Electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons when the atom is part of a compound. Electronegativity differs from electron affinity because electron affinity is a measure of the actual energy released when an atom gains an electron. In contrast, electronegativity is a relative scale, so it is not measured in units of energy. All elements are compared to one another, and the most electronegative element, fluorine, is assigned an electronegativity value of 3.98. Fluorine attracts shared electrons better than any other element. Figure below shows the electronegativity values of most elements.\n\n### ANSWER\nB<|im_end|>\n","ROUGE-1":0.4498269896,"ROUGE-2":0.3205574913,"ROUGE-L":0.3598615917,"BLEU":0.2081538161,"BERTScore_P":0.7994326353,"BERTScore_R":0.6646770239,"BERTScore_F1":0.7258534431}

Oxygen is reduced to water at a different site on the surface of the iron, which acts as the cathode. Electrons are transferred from the anode to the cathode through the electrically conductive metal. Water is a solvent for the Fe2+ that is produced initially and acts as a salt bridge. Rust (Fe2O3\u00b7xH2O) is formed by the subsequent oxidation of Fe2+ by atmospheric oxygen. In the corrosion process, iron metal acts as the anode in a galvanic cell and is oxidized to Fe2+; oxygen is reduced to water at the cathode.

Sharp teeth in the front of the mouth cut or tear food when you bite into it (see Figure below ). Broad teeth in the back of the mouth grind food when you chew. Food is easier to chew because it is moistened by saliva from the salivary glands. The tongue helps mix the food with saliva and also helps you swallow.

The two basic types of lymphocytes, B cells and T cells, are identical morphologically with a large central nucleus surrounded by a thin layer of cytoplasm. They are distinguished from each other by their surface protein markers as well as by the molecules they secrete. While B cells mature in red bone marrow and T cells mature in the thymus, they both initially develop from bone marrow. T cells migrate from bone marrow to the thymus gland where they further mature. B cells and T cells are found in many parts of the body, circulating in the bloodstream and lymph, and residing in secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen and lymph nodes, which will be described later in this section.

The urea cycle occurs primarily in the liver. The urea molecule is formed from two molecules of carbon dioxide and one molecule of ammonia. The urea is then transported to the kidneys, where it is excreted in the urine. The urea produced in the liver is then recycled back to the kidneys to be excreted in urine. The ureters are the tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder. The urethra is the tube that transports urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.\n\n### ANSWER\nA","expected":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful EPFL chatbot.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n### QUESTION\nThe urea cycle, a set of biochemical reactions that produces urea from ammonium ions to prevent toxicity, occurs to some extent in the kidney, but primarily in what organ?\n\n###OPTIONS\nA: liver\nB: colon\nC: skin\nD: spleen\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n### EXPLANATION\nUrea Cycle The urea cycle is a set of biochemical reactions that produces urea from ammonium ions in order to prevent a toxic level of ammonium in the body. It occurs primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney. Prior to the urea cycle, ammonium ions are produced from the breakdown of amino acids. In these reactions, an amine group, or ammonium ion, from the amino acid is exchanged with a keto group on another molecule. This transamination event creates a molecule that is necessary for the Krebs cycle and an ammonium ion that enters into the urea cycle to be eliminated. In the urea cycle, ammonium is combined with CO2, resulting in urea and water. The urea is eliminated through the kidneys in the urine (Figure 24.18).\n\n### ANSWER\nA<|im_end|>\n","ROUGE-1":0.6538461538,"ROUGE-2":0.4640883978,"ROUGE-L":0.521978022,"BLEU":0.4475340798,"BERTScore_P":0.8007696867,"BERTScore_R":0.7762407064,"BERTScore_F1":0.7883144021}
