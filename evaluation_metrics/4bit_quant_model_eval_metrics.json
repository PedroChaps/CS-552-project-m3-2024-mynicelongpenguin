Chemical bonds are the basis for how elements combine with one another to form compounds. When these chemical bonds form, atoms of some elements have a greater ability to attract the valence electrons involved in the bond than other elements. Electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons when the atom is part of a compound. Electronegativity differs from electron affinity because electron affinity is a measure of the actual energy released when an atom gains an electron. In contrast, electronegativity is a relative scale, so it is not measured in units of energy. All elements are compared to one another, and the most electronegative element, fluorine, is assigned an electronegativity value of 3.98. Fluorine attracts shared electrons better than any other element.

Anodic oxidation is the loss of electrons by the metal. For example, iron is oxidized to Fe2+ (aq) at the anodic site on its surface. The anodic site is an impurity or defect in the metal.\n\n### ANSWER\nA","expected":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful EPFL chatbot.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n### QUESTION\nIron is oxidized to fe2+(aq) at an anodic site on the surface of the iron, which is often an impurity or this?\n\n###OPTIONS\nA: displacement defect\nB: ladder complex\nC: spontaneous mutation\nD: lattice defect\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n### EXPLANATION\nIron is oxidized to Fe2+(aq) at an anodic site on the surface of the iron, which is often an impurity or a lattice defect. Oxygen is reduced to water at a different site on the surface of the iron, which acts as the cathode. Electrons are transferred from the anode to the cathode through the electrically conductive metal. Water is a solvent for the Fe2+ that is produced initially and acts as a salt bridge. Rust (Fe2O3\u00b7xH2O) is formed by the subsequent oxidation of Fe2+ by atmospheric oxygen. In the corrosion process, iron metal acts as the anode in a galvanic cell and is oxidized to Fe2+; oxygen is reduced to water at the cathode. The relevant reactions are as follows:.\n\n### ANSWER\nD<|im_end|>\n","ROUGE-1":0.6458333333,"ROUGE-2":0.4755244755,"ROUGE-L":0.5277777778,"BLEU":0.3599319759,"BERTScore_P":0.8622486591,"BERTScore_R":0.7567253709,"BERTScore_F1":0.8060480952}

Sharp teeth in the front of the mouth cut or tear food when you bite into it (see Figure below ). Broad teeth in the back of the mouth grind food when you chew. Food is easier to chew because it is moistened by saliva from the salivary glands. The tongue helps mix the food with saliva and also helps you swallow. After you swallow, the chewed food passes into the pharynx.\n\n### ANSWER\nA<|im_end|>\n","ROUGE-1":0.4936708861,"ROUGE-2":0.4358974359,"ROUGE-L":0.4810126582,"BLEU":0.2238694428,"BERTScore_P":0.9072763324,"BERTScore_R":0.702827096,"BERTScore_F1":0.7920714021}

The two basic types of lymphocytes, B cells and T cells, are identical morphologically with a large central nucleus surrounded by a thin layer of cytoplasm. They are distinguished from each other by their surface protein markers as well as by the molecules they secrete. While B cells mature in red bone marrow and T cells mature in the thymus, they both initially develop from bone marrow. T cells migrate from bone marrow to the thymus gland where they further mature. B cells and T cells are found in many parts of the body, circulating in the bloodstream and lymph, and residing in secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen and lymph nodes, which will be described later in this section. The human body contains approximately 10 12 lymphocytes.\n\n### ANSWER\nA<|im_end|>\n","ROUGE-1":0.4015444015,"ROUGE-2":0.3346303502,"ROUGE-L":0.3783783784,"BLEU":0.1267980309,"BERTScore_P":0.8809986711,"BERTScore_R":0.6434266567,"BERTScore_F1":0.7437006831}

It occurs primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney. Prior to the urea cycle, ammonium ions are produced from the breakdown of amino acids. In these reactions, an amine group, or ammonium ion, from the amino acid is exchanged with a keto group on another molecule. This transamination event creates a molecule that is necessary for the Krebs cycle and an ammonium ion that enters into the urea cycle to be eliminated. In the urea cycle, ammonium is combined with CO2, resulting in urea and water. The urea is eliminated through the kidneys in the urine (Figure 24.18).\n\n### ANSWER\nA<|im_end|>\n","ROUGE-1":0.5944055944,"ROUGE-2":0.5211267606,"ROUGE-L":0.5454545455,"BLEU":0.3007473157,"BERTScore_P":0.8892515898,"BERTScore_R":0.7525764704,"BERTScore_F1":0.815225184}
