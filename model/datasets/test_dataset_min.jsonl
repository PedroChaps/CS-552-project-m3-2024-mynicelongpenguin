The total energy conversion rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and is divided among various systems in the body, as shown in Table 7.4. The largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen, with the brain coming next. Of course, during vigorous exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart increase markedly. About 75% of the calories burned in a day go into these basic functions. The BMR is a function of age, gender, total body weight, and amount of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat). Athletes have a greater BMR due to this last factor.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: What is the term for a solution that resists dramatic changes in ph?\n\nOptions:\nA. inert\nB. buffer\nC. neutral\nD. stable\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"As indicated in Section 12.4 \"Strong and Weak Acids and Bases and Their Salts\", weak acids are relatively common, even in the foods we eat. But we occasionally encounter a strong acid or base, such as stomach acid, which has a strongly acidic pH of 1.7. By definition, strong acids and bases can produce a relatively large amount of H+ or OH\u2212ions and consequently have marked chemical activities. In addition, very small amounts of strong acids and bases can change the pH of a solution very quickly. If 1 mL of stomach acid [approximated as 0.1 M HCl(aq)] were added to the bloodstream and no correcting mechanism were present, the pH of the blood would decrease from about 7.4 to about 4.7\u2014a pH that is not conducive to continued living. Fortunately, the body has a mechanism for minimizing such dramatic pH changes. The mechanism involves a buffer, a solution that resists dramatic changes in pH. Buffers do so by being composed of certain pairs of solutes: either a weak acid plus a salt derived from that weak acid or a weak base plus a salt of that weak base. For example, a buffer can be composed of dissolved HC2H3O2 (a weak acid) and NaC2H3O2 (the salt derived from that weak acid). Another example of a buffer is a solution containing NH3 (a weak base) and NH4Cl (a salt derived from that weak base). Let us use an HC2H3O2\/NaC2H3O2 buffer to demonstrate how buffers work. If a strong base\u2014a source of OH\u2212(aq) ions\u2014is added to the buffer solution, those OH\u2212 ions will react with the HC2H3O2 in an acid-base reaction:.","related":true}

A much smaller group of autotrophs - mostly bacteria in dark or low-oxygen environments - produce food using the chemical energy stored in inorganic molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, or methane. While photosynthesis transforms light energy to chemical energy, this alternate method of making food transfers chemical energy from inorganic to organic molecules. It is therefore called chemosynthesis , and is characteristic of the tubeworms shown in Figure below . Some of the most recently discovered chemosynthetic bacteria inhabit deep ocean hot water vents or \u201cblack smokers. \u201d There, they use the energy in gases from the Earth\u2019s interior to produce food for a variety of unique heterotrophs: giant tube worms, blind shrimp, giant white crabs, and armored snails. Some scientists think that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of Mars, Jupiter's moon, Europa, and other planets as well. Ecosystems based on chemosynthesis may seem rare and exotic, but they too illustrate the absolute dependence of heterotrophs on autotrophs for food.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: What happens to cells in a hypertonic solution as water leaves the cell via osmosis?\n\nOptions:\nA. evaporation\nB. shrinkage\nC. self destruction\nD. get larger\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"The movement of water molecules is not itself regulated by cells, so it is important that cells are exposed to an environment in which the concentration of solutes outside of the cells (in the extracellular fluid) is equal to the concentration of solutes inside the cells (in the cytoplasm). Two solutions that have the same concentration of solutes are said to be isotonic (equal tension). When cells and their extracellular environments are isotonic, the concentration of water molecules is the same outside and inside the cells, and the cells maintain their normal shape (and function). Osmosis occurs when there is an imbalance of solutes outside of a cell versus inside the cell. A solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than another solution is said to be hypertonic, and water molecules tend to diffuse into a hypertonic solution (Figure 3.8). Cells in a hypertonic solution will shrivel as water leaves the cell via osmosis. In contrast, a solution that has a lower concentration of solutes than another solution is said to be hypotonic, and water molecules tend to diffuse out of a hypotonic solution. Cells in a hypotonic solution will take on too much water and swell, with the risk of eventually bursting. A critical aspect of homeostasis in living things is to create an internal environment in which all of the body\u2019s cells are in an isotonic solution. Various organ systems, particularly the kidneys, work to maintain this homeostasis.","related":true}

Since the base of the semi-circle is 20, we know that the diameter is 20 and, accordingly, the radius is 10.\nWe also know that the traffic lane is 12 feet long and there's an equal amount of space on either side, so the traffic lane extends 6 feet on either side of O. Let's call the leftmost point on the base of the traffic lane A. So, the distance OA is 6.\nNow draw a line straight up from A to the top of the tunnel. Let's label the point at which the line intersects the circle B. The answer to the question will, therefore, be the height AB - .5 feet (we need to leave .5 feet of clearance).\nHere's the key to solving the question: if we draw a line from O to B, that line is a radius of the circle and, therefore, has length 10. We now have right triangle OAB (the right angle is at point A), with leg OA=6 and hypotenuse OB=10. We can now solve for leg AB=8 (either by applying the pythagorean theorum or by applying the 3\/4\/5 special right triangle ratio).\nFinally: AB=8, so the correct answer U is 8 - .5 = 7.5... choose (B)!\nFrom a strategic guessing point of view, as soon as we realize that the height of the tunnel is 10 in the middle, we should quickly eliminate (D) and (E) as too big; worse case you have a 1\/3 shot at picking up the points.B","related":null}

{"question":"Question: The part of the ecosystem required by a particular species is endangered when human activity threatens loss of what?\n\nOptions:\nA. biodiversity\nB. primary speciation\nC. primary producers\nD. habitat\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"Habitat Loss Humans rely on technology to modify their environment and replace certain functions that were once performed by the natural ecosystem. Other species cannot do this. Elimination of their habitat\u2014whether it is a forest, coral reef, grassland, or flowing river\u2014will kill the individuals in the species. Remove the entire habitat within the range of a species and, unless they are one of the few species that do well in human-built environments, the species will become extinct. Human destruction of habitats (habitats generally refer to the part of the ecosystem required by a particular species) accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century. Consider the exceptional biodiversity of Sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of critically endangered elephant, and the Sumatran tiger, but half of Sumatra\u2019s forest is now gone. The neighboring island of Borneo, home to the other species of orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest. Forest loss continues in protected areas of Borneo. The orangutan in Borneo is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it is simply the most visible of thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests of Borneo. The forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations (Figure 21.8). Palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics, and biodiesel in Europe. A 5-year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years from 2000 to 2005 was 3.1 percent. Much loss (2.4 percent) occurred in the humid tropics where forest loss is primarily from timber extraction. These losses certainly also represent the extinction of species unique to those areas.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: At the time of birth, bones of the brain case are separated by what wide areas of fibrous connective tissue, which later become sutures?\n\nOptions:\nA. fluctuations\nB. cerebellum\nC. sporozoans\nD. fontanelles\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"7.5 Embryonic Development of the Axial Skeleton Formation of the axial skeleton begins during early embryonic development with the appearance of the rod-like notochord along the dorsal length of the early embryo. Repeating, paired blocks of tissue called somites then appear along either side of notochord. As the somites grow, they split into parts, one of which is called a sclerotome. This consists of mesenchyme, the embryonic tissue that will become the bones, cartilages, and connective tissues of the body. Mesenchyme in the head region will produce the bones of the skull via two different mechanisms. The bones of the brain case arise via intramembranous ossification in which embryonic mesenchyme tissue converts directly into bone. At the time of birth, these bones are separated by fontanelles, wide areas of fibrous connective tissue. As the bones grow, the fontanelles are reduced to sutures, which allow for continued growth of the skull throughout childhood. In contrast, the cranial base and facial bones are produced by the process of endochondral ossification, in which mesenchyme tissue initially produces a hyaline cartilage model of the future bone. The cartilage model allows for growth of the bone and is gradually converted into bone over a period of many years. The vertebrae, ribs, and sternum also develop via endochondral ossification. Mesenchyme accumulates around the notochord and produces hyaline cartilage models of the vertebrae. The notochord largely disappears, but remnants of the notochord contribute to formation of the intervertebral discs. In the thorax region, a portion of the vertebral cartilage model splits off to form the ribs. These then become attached anteriorly to the developing cartilage model of the sternum. Growth of the cartilage models for the vertebrae, ribs, and sternum allow for enlargement of the thoracic cage during childhood and adolescence. The cartilage models gradually undergo ossification and are converted into bone.","related":true}

The average winter temperature is -34 \u00b0C (-34 \u00b0F) and the average summer temperature is from 3 \u00b0C to 12 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F\u201352 \u00b0F). Plants in the arctic tundra have a very short growing season of approximately 10\u201312 weeks. However, during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid. The annual precipitation of the Arctic tundra is very low with little annual variation in precipitation. And, as in the boreal forests, there is little evaporation due to the cold temperatures. Plants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground (Figure 44.20). There is little species diversity, low net primary productivity, and low aboveground biomass. The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost. The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter, which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter. During the growing season, the ground of the Arctic tundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens.","related":true}

The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons. In the case of zinc and carbon electrodes, the zinc electrode attracts electrons and becomes negatively charged, while the carbon electrode gives up electrons and becomes positively charged. Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode. If wires are used to connect the two electrodes at their terminal ends, electric current will flow through the wires and can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device.","related":true}

In that case, a = b = c. So statement II can hold.\nAssuming p and q are not 0,\n(1 + q%)(1 - p%) = 1 = No change\nSo if you increase something by q% (it becomes bigger) and then decrease it by p% (now you will need to decrease it by a lesser %), there is no change.\nSuch as, you increase 100 by 25% and it becomes 125. Then you decrease 125 by only 20% and it comes back to 100. (This should remind you of cost price, sale price, profit and margin). So q would be a higher percentage than p.\nNow if you increase something by p% (the lower %) and then decrease by q% (the higher %), the value you will obtain will certainly be lower than original.\nSay you increase a (100) by p% (20%) to get 120 and then decrease it by q% (25%), you will get c (90). Hence c < a is possible too.\nAnswer (E)","related":null}

{"question":"Question: What asymmetrical organ has four chambers and, in humans, is about the size of a clenched fist?\n\nOptions:\nA. heart\nB. liver\nC. brain\nD. kidney\n\nAnswer:","answer":"A","explanation":"Structure of the Heart The heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Since the right side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to the whole body in the systemic circuit, as shown in Figure 40.11. In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. In addition, the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the backflow of blood. The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve. After it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, by-passing the semilunar valve (or pulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries, the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. The left atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. This blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through aorta, the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle. This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals.","related":true}

Therefore, both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity; mixing results in a diluted (brackish) salt water. Estuaries form protected areas where many of the offspring of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish begin their lives. Salinity is an important factor that influences the organisms and the adaptations of the organisms found in estuaries. The salinity of estuaries varies and is based on the rate of flow of its freshwater sources. Once or twice a day, high tides bring salt water into the estuary. Low tides occurring at the same frequency reverse the current of salt water (Figure 20.30).","related":true}

{"question":"Question: What is used for cooling detectors of infrared telescopes?\n\nOptions:\nA. material nitrogen\nB. liquid nitrogen\nC. hand nitrogen\nD. carbon dioxide\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"Detecting Electromagnetic Waves from Space A final note on star gazing. The entire electromagnetic spectrum is used by researchers for investigating stars, space, and time. As noted earlier, Penzias and Wilson detected microwaves to identify the background radiation originating from the Big Bang. Radio telescopes such as the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico and Parkes Observatory in Australia were designed to detect radio waves. Infrared telescopes need to have their detectors cooled by liquid nitrogen to be able to gather useful signals. Since infrared radiation is predominantly from thermal agitation, if the detectors were not cooled, the vibrations of the molecules in the antenna would be stronger than the signal being collected. The most famous of these infrared sensitive telescopes is the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii. The earliest telescopes, developed in the seventeenth century, were optical telescopes, collecting visible light. Telescopes in the ultraviolet, X-ray, and \u03b3 -ray regions are placed outside the atmosphere on satellites orbiting the Earth. The Hubble Space Telescope (launched in 1990) gathers ultraviolet radiation as well as visible light. In the X-ray region, there is the Chandra X-ray Observatory (launched in 1999), and in the \u03b3 -ray region, there is the new Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (launched in 2008\u2014taking the place of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, 1991\u20132000.

{"question":"Question: If n is a positive integer and n^2 is divisible by 264, then the largest positive integer that must divide n is\n\nOptions:\nA)6\nB)12\nC)24\nD)36\nE)48\n\nAnswer:","answer":"E","explanation":"The question asks aboutthe largest positive integer that MUST divide n, not COULD divide n. Since the least value of n for which n^2 is a multiple of 72 is 12 then the largest positive integer that MUST divide n is 12.\nComplete solution of this question is given above. Please ask if anything remains unclear.\nI spent a few hours on this one alone and I'm still not clear. I chose 12 at first, but then changed to 48.\nI'm not a native speaker, so here is how I interpreted this question:the largest positive integer that must divide n=the largest positive factor of n. Since n is a variable (i.e. n is moving), so is its largest factor. Please correct if I'm wrong here.\nI know that if n = 12, n^2 = 144 = 2 * 72 (satisfy the condition). When n = 12, the largest factor of n is n itself, which is 12. Check: 12 is the largest positive number that must divide 12 --> true\nHowever if n = 48, n^2 = 48 * 48 = 32 * 72 (satisfy the condition too). When n = 48, the largest factor of n is n itself, which is 48. Check: 48 is the largest positive number that must divide 48 --> true\nSo, I also notice that the keyword isMUST, notCOULD. The question is, why is 48 notMUST divide 48, but instead onlyCOULD divide 48? I'm not clear right here. Why is 12MUST divide 12? What's the difference between them?\nOnly restriction we have on positive integer n is that n^2 is divisible by 72. The least value of n for which n^2 is divisible by 72 is 12, thus nmustbe divisible by 12 (n is in any case divisible by 12). For all other values of n, for which n^2 is divisible by 72, n will still be divisible by 12. This means that n is always divisible by 12 if n^2 is divisible by 72.\nNow, ask yourself: if n=48, is n divisible by 48? No. So, n is not always divisible by 48.\nE","related":null}

It occurs primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney. Prior to the urea cycle, ammonium ions are produced from the breakdown of amino acids. In these reactions, an amine group, or ammonium ion, from the amino acid is exchanged with a keto group on another molecule. This transamination event creates a molecule that is necessary for the Krebs cycle and an ammonium ion that enters into the urea cycle to be eliminated. In the urea cycle, ammonium is combined with CO2, resulting in urea and water. The urea is eliminated through the kidneys in the urine (Figure 24.18).","related":true}

It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base. Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base, and then polymerization continues (Figure 9.13a). Most mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is employed. Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the DNA, replacing it with the correct base (Figure 9.13b). In yet another type of repair, nucleotide excision repair, the DNA double strand is unwound and separated, the incorrect bases are removed along with a few bases on the 5' and 3' end, and these are replaced by copying the template with the help of DNA polymerase (Figure 9.13c). Nucleotide excision repair is particularly important in correcting thymine dimers, which are primarily caused by ultraviolet light. In a thymine dimer, two thymine nucleotides adjacent to each other on one strand are covalently bonded to each other rather than their complementary bases. If the dimer is not removed and repaired it will lead to a mutation. Individuals with flaws in their nucleotide excision repair genes show extreme sensitivity to sunlight and develop skin cancers early in life.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: A pharmaceutical company received $7 million in royalties on the first $20 million in sales of the generic equivalent of one of its products and then $9 million in royalties on the next $108 million in sales. By approximately what percent did the ratio of royalties to sales decrease from the first $20 million in sales to the next $108 million in sales?\n\nOptions:\nA)8%\nB)15%\nC)45%\nD)52%\nE)76%\n\nAnswer:","answer":"E","explanation":"Solution:\nThis is a percent decrease problem. We will use the formula: percent change = (new \u2013 old)\/old x 100 to calculate the final answer.\nWe first set up the ratios of royalties to sales. The first ratio will be for the first 20 million in sales, and the second ratio will be for the next 108 million in sales. Because all of the sales are in millions, we do not have to express all the trailing zeros in our ratios.\nFirst 20 Million\nroyalties\/sales = 7\/20\nNext 108 Million\nroyalties\/sales = 9\/108 = 1\/12\nBecause each ratio is not an easy number to use, we can simplify each one by multiplying each by the LCM of the two denominators, which is 60. Keep in mind that we are able to do this only because our answer choices are expressed in percents.\nFirst 20 Million\nroyalties\/sales = (7\/20) x 60 = 21\nNext 108 Million\nroyalties\/sales = 9\/108 = (1\/12) x 60 = 5\nWe can plug 9 and 5 into our percent change formula:\n(new \u2013 old)\/old x 100\n[(5 \u2013 21)\/21] x 100\n-1600\/21 x 100\nAt this point we can stop and consider the answer choices. Since we know that 1600\/21 is just a bit less than \u00bd, we know that -1600\/21 x 100 is about a 76% decrease.\nAnswer E.","related":null}

{"question":"Question: Calvin cycle reactions can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and this?\n\nOptions:\nA. transformation\nB. creation\nC. demarcation\nD. regeneration\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"The Calvin cycle reactions (Figure 5.15) can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and regeneration. In the stroma, in addition to CO2, two other chemicals are present to initiate the Calvin cycle: an enzyme abbreviated RuBisCO, and the molecule ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). RuBP has five atoms of carbon and a phosphate group on each end. RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO2 and RuBP, which forms a six-carbon compound that is immediately converted into two three-carbon compounds. This process is called carbon fixation, because CO2 is \u201cfixed\u201d from its inorganic form into organic molecules. ATP and NADPH use their stored energy to convert the three-carbon compound, 3-PGA, into another three-carbon compound called G3P. This type of reaction is called a reduction reaction, because it involves the gain of electrons. A reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule. The molecules of ADP and NAD+, resulting from the reduction reaction, return to the light-dependent reactions to be re-energized. One of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle to contribute to the formation of the carbohydrate molecule, which is commonly glucose (C6H12O6). Because the carbohydrate molecule has six carbon atoms, it takes six turns of the Calvin cycle to make one carbohydrate molecule (one for each carbon dioxide molecule fixed). The remaining G3P molecules regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for the carbon-fixation step. ATP is also used in the regeneration of RuBP.","related":true}
{"question":"Question: Which forces hold particles together in more ordered states?\n\nOptions:\nA. gravitational\nB. particular\nC. natural\nD. intermolecular\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"Chemical energy, the energy stored in molecules and atoms, is one type of potential energy. Certain reactions can cause this energy to be released as heat. Other reactions require an input of energy, in which case the products will store more potential energy than the reactants. When we studied phase changes, we saw a relationship between energy and the state of matter. To melt a solid or boil a liquid, energy needs to be added in order to break up the intermolecular forces holding particles together in more ordered states. The reverse processes, condensation and freezing, release energy, because more favorable intermolecular interactions are formed.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: Osmosis is driven by the imbalance of what?\n\nOptions:\nA. precipitation\nB. water concentration\nC. isolation\nD. evaporation\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"Osmosis is the transport of water through a semipermeable membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Osmosis is driven by the imbalance in water concentration. For example, water is more concentrated in your body than in Epsom salt. When you soak a swollen ankle in Epsom salt, the water moves out of your body into the lower-concentration region in the salt. Similarly, dialysis is the transport of any other molecule through a semipermeable membrane due to its concentration difference. Both osmosis and dialysis are used by the kidneys to cleanse the blood. Osmosis can create a substantial pressure. Consider what happens if osmosis continues for some time, as illustrated in Figure 12.23. Water moves by osmosis from the left into the region on the right, where it is less concentrated, causing the solution on the right to rise. This movement will continue until the pressure \u03c1gh created by the extra height of fluid on the right is large enough to stop further osmosis. This pressure is called a back pressure.

Fishes were the earliest vertebrates, and jawless fishes were the earliest of these. Jawless fishes\u2014the present day hagfishes and lampreys\u2014have a distinct cranium and complex sense organs including eyes, distinguishing them from the invertebrate chordates. The jawed fishes evolved later and are extraordinarily diverse today. Fishes are active feeders, rather than sessile, suspension feeders. Jawless Fishes Jawless fishes are craniates (which includes all the chordate groups except the tunicates and lancelets) that represent an ancient vertebrate lineage that arose over one half-billion years ago. Some of the earliest jawless fishes were the ostracoderms (which translates as \u201cshell-skin\u201d). Ostracoderms, now extinct, were vertebrate fishes encased in bony armor, unlike present-day jawless fishes, which lack bone in their scales. The clade Myxini includes 67 species of hagfishes. Hagfishes are eel-like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates, other fishes, and marine mammals (Figure 15.37a). Hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world except for the polar regions. A unique feature of these animals is the slime glands beneath the skin that are able to release an extraordinary amount of mucus through surface pores. This mucus may allow the hagfish to escape from the grip of predators. Hagfish are known to enter the bodies of dead or dying organisms to devour them from the inside.","related":true}

The end of the muscle that attaches to the bone being pulled is called the muscle\u2019s insertion and the end of the muscle attached to a fixed, or stabilized, bone is called the origin. The muscle primarily responsible for a movement is called the prime mover, and muscles that assist in this action are called synergists. A synergist that makes the insertion site more stable is called a fixator. Meanwhile, a muscle with the opposite action of the prime mover is called an antagonist. Several factors contribute to the force generated by a skeletal muscle. One is the arrangement of the fascicles in the skeletal muscle. Fascicles can be parallel, circular, convergent, pennate, fusiform, or triangular. Each arrangement has its own range of motion and ability to do work.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: The larger surface area of leaves allows them to capture more what?\n\nOptions:\nA. molecules\nB. sunlight\nC. pollen\nD. chlorophyll\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"Roots: Support for the Plant Roots are not well preserved in the fossil record; nevertheless, it seems that they did appear later in evolution than vascular tissue. The development of an extensive network of roots represented a significant new feature of vascular plants. Thin rhizoids attached the bryophytes to the substrate. Their rather flimsy filaments did not provide a strong anchor for the plant; neither did they absorb water and nutrients. In contrast, roots, with their prominent vascular tissue system, transfer water and minerals from the soil to the rest of the plant. The extensive network of roots that penetrates deep in the ground to reach sources of water also stabilizes trees by acting as ballast and an anchor. The majority of roots establish a symbiotic relationship with fungi, forming mycorrhizae. In the mycorrhizae, fungal hyphae grow around the root and within the root around the cells, and in some instances within the cells. This benefits the plant by greatly increasing the surface area for absorption. Leaves, Sporophylls, and Strobili A third adaptation marks seedless vascular plants. Accompanying the prominence of the sporophyte and the development of vascular tissue, the appearance of true leaves improved photosynthetic efficiency. Leaves capture more sunlight with their increased surface area. In addition to photosynthesis, leaves play another role in the life of the plants. Pinecones, mature fronds of ferns, and flowers are all sporophylls\u2014leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia. Strobili are structures that contain the sporangia. They are prominent in conifers and are known commonly as cones: for example, the pine cones of pine trees.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: When the maximum amount of solute has been dissolved in a given amount of solvent, we say that the solution is what?\n\nOptions:\nA. empty\nB. blended\nC. saturated\nD. used\n\nAnswer:","answer":"C","explanation":"When the maximum amount of solute has been dissolved in a given amount of solvent, we say that the solution is saturated with solute. When less than the maximum amount of solute is dissolved in a given amount of solute, the solution is unsaturated. These terms are also qualitative terms because each solute has its own solubility. A solution of 0.00019 g of AgCl per 100 g of H2O may be saturated, but with so little solute dissolved, it is also rather dilute. A solution of 36.1 g of NaCl in 100 g of H2O is also saturated but rather concentrated. Ideally, we need more precise ways of specifying the amount of solute in a solution. We will introduce such ways in Section 11.2 \"Quantitative Units of Concentration\". In some circumstances, it is possible to dissolve more than the maximum amount of a solute in a solution. Usually, this happens by heating the solvent, dissolving more solute than would normally dissolve at regular temperatures, and letting the solution cool down slowly and carefully. Such solutions are called supersaturated solutions and are not stable; given an opportunity (such as dropping a crystal of solute in the solution), the excess solute will precipitate from the solution. It should be obvious that some solutes dissolve in certain solvents but not others. NaCl, for example, dissolves in water but not in vegetable oil. Beeswax dissolves in liquid hexane but not water. What is it that makes a solute soluble in some solvents but not others? The answer is intermolecular interactions. The intermolecular interactions include London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding (as described in Chapter 10 \"Solids and Liquids\"). From experimental studies, it has been determined that if molecules of a solute experience the Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: S is a set containing 6 different positive odd primes. T is a set containing 8 different numbers, all of which are members of S.

The question states:S is a set containing 9 different positive odd primes. T is a set containing 8 different numbers, all of which are members of S. Which of the following statements CANNOT be true?\n(A) The median of S is prime.\nThismust be true. If there are an odd number of members of a set, then the median is a member of the set: it's the middle number, when all the numbers are ranked from smallest to biggest. Every number in S is a positive odd prime, so the median is one of them, and is prime.\n(B) The median of T is prime.\nThismay or may not be true. If a set has an even number of members, the median is average of the two numbers in the middle, when ranked from smallest to biggest. The average of two odd numberscould beeven (average of 71 and 73 is 72), and hence not prime, or itcould beodd (the average of 71 and 79 is 75). For particularly well chosen odd numbers, the average can be not only odd but also prime -- for example, the average of 89 and 113 is 101, another prime number. If the two middle numbers of T were 89 and 113, the median would be 101, a prime number.\n(C) The median of S is equal to the median of T.\nUnder most configurations for S and T, this wouldn't happen. If you weren't trying to make it happen, it would be unlikely to happen by chance. BUT, if the number dropped going from from S to T was the median of S (say, 101), and if the two middle numbers of T happen to have an average of that number that was dropped (for example, if the two numbers were 89 and 113), then the medians would be equal. In other words, the three middle numbers of S would have to be {. . ., 89, 101, 133, . . .}, and when 101 is dropped in going to T, the median of two would be the average of 89113, which happens to be 101. It's an exceptional case, but itcouldbe true.\n(D) The sum of the terms in S is prime.\nThismay or may not be true. The sum of 9 odd numbermustbe an odd number. That odd numbercould beprime. For example, the sum of the first nine odd prime numbers {3, 5, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} is 127, which is prime. If you drop 3 and include the next prime, 31, the set {5, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31} has a sum of 155, which is clearly not prime.\n(E) The sum of the terms in T is prime.\nThismust be false. The sum of eight odd numbers must be an even number. Only 2 is prime, and all other even numbers are not. Therefore, the sum of eight odd prime numbers will be an even number bigger than two, and absolutely cannot be prime.\nD","related":null}

{"question":"Question: Uncontrolled cell growth can lead to tumors and what disease?\n\nOptions:\nA. cirrhosis\nB. kidney failure\nC. vascular disease\nD. cancer\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"10.4 | Cancer and the Cell Cycle By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Describe how cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell growth \u2022 Understand how proto-oncogenes are normal cell genes that, when mutated, become oncogenes \u2022 Describe how tumor suppressors function \u2022 Explain how mutant tumor suppressors cause cancer Cancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth. Despite the redundancy and overlapping levels of cell cycle control, errors do occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the cell cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of the cell cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. If changes to the DNA nucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected, a gene mutation results. All cancers start when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction. The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in the binding of Cdk to cyclin or an Rb protein that detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated. Even minor mistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, small uncorrected errors are passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage. Eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor (\u201c-oma\u201d) can result.","related":true}

We can examine the x and y coordinates separately since they are independent.\n*It should be noted that there are two solutions to this problem, one point between C and D, and another point with D in the middle of C and the point. We can quickly look at the answer choices and see that all the points are between C and D, therefore we can search for that point using the following method:\nTaking the x-coordinate first, the distance between C and D is |(x-coordinate of C) - (x-coordinate of D)|= |5 - (-1)| = 6\nThe x-coordinate that is twice as far from C as it is from D (and in between C and D) will be 4 units from C and 2 units from D. So the x coordinate of the point we're looking for is 5-4 = 1, or (-1)+2 = 1.\nNow looking at the y-coordinate, we do the same thing. The distance between C and D is |(-2) - 2.5| = 4.5\nThe y-coordinate that is twice as far from C as it is from D (and in between C and D) will be 3 units from C and 1.5 units from D. So the y coordinate of the point we're looking for is (-2)+3 = 1, or 2.5-1.5 = 1.\nSo now we have our coordinates of the point on the line that is twice as far from C as it is from D: (2,0.25)\nAnswer: C","related":null}

{"question":"Question: Cells in green algae divide along cell plates called what?\n\nOptions:\nA. xanthophylls\nB. cellulose\nC. chloroplasts\nD. phragmoplasts\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"Streptophytes Until recently, all photosynthetic eukaryotes were considered members of the kingdom Plantae. The brown, red, and gold algae, however, have been reassigned to the Protista kingdom. This is because apart from their ability to capture light energy and fix CO2, they lack many structural and biochemical traits that distinguish plants from protists. The position of green algae is more ambiguous. Green algae contain the same carotenoids and chlorophyll a and b as land plants, whereas other algae have different accessory pigments and types of chlorophyll molecules in addition to chlorophyll a. Both green algae and land plants also store carbohydrates as starch. Cells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts, and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes. Consequently, land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta. The remaining green algae, which belong to a group called Chlorophyta, include more than 7000 different species that live in fresh or brackish water, in seawater, or in snow patches. A few green algae even survive on soil, provided it is covered by a thin film of moisture in which they can live. Periodic dry spells provide a selective advantage to algae that can survive water stress. Some green algae may already be familiar, in particular Spirogyra and desmids. Their cells contain chloroplasts that display a dizzying variety of shapes, and their cell walls contain cellulose, as do land plants. Some green algae are single cells, such as Chlorella and Chlamydomonas, which adds to the ambiguity of green algae classification, because plants are multicellular. Other algae, like Ulva (commonly called sea lettuce), form colonies (Figure 25.7).","related":true}

{"question":"Question: Metabolic enzymes catalyze catabolic reactions that break down what?\n\nOptions:\nA. proteins\nB. lipids\nC. impurities\nD. carbohydrates\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"24.2 Carbohydrate Metabolism Metabolic enzymes catalyze catabolic reactions that break down carbohydrates contained in food. The energy released is used to power the cells and systems that make up your body. Excess or unutilized energy is stored as fat or glycogen for later use. Carbohydrate metabolism begins in the mouth, where the enzyme salivary amylase begins to break down complex sugars into monosaccharides. These can then be transported across the intestinal membrane into the bloodstream and then to body tissues. In the cells, glucose, a six-carbon sugar, is processed through a sequence of reactions into smaller sugars, and the energy stored inside the molecule is released. The first step of carbohydrate catabolism is glycolysis, which produces pyruvate, NADH, and ATP. Under anaerobic conditions, the pyruvate can be converted into lactate to keep glycolysis working. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition to ATP, the Krebs cycle produces high-energy FADH2 and NADH molecules, which provide electrons to the oxidative phosphorylation process that generates more high-energy ATP molecules. For each molecule of glucose that is processed in glycolysis, a net of 36 ATPs can be created by aerobic respiration. Under anaerobic conditions, ATP production is limited to those generated by glycolysis. While a total of four ATPs are produced by glycolysis, two are needed to begin glycolysis, so there is a net yield of two ATP molecules. In conditions of low glucose, such as fasting, starvation, or low carbohydrate diets, glucose can be synthesized from lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, alanine, or glutamate. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is almost the reverse of glycolysis and serves to create glucose molecules for glucose-dependent organs, such as the brain, when glucose levels fall below normal.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: What is the main artery of the systematic circulation called?\n\nOptions:\nA. subclavian\nB. aorta\nC. femoral\nD. carotid\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"Blood Vessels The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels (Figure 16.12). Arteries take blood away from the heart. The main artery of the systemic circulation is the aorta; it branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs. The aorta and arteries near the heart have heavy but elastic walls that respond to and smooth out the pressure differences caused by the beating heart. Arteries farther away from the heart have more muscle tissue in their walls that can constrict to affect flow rates of blood. The major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and then smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body. Arterioles diverge into capillary beds. Capillary beds contain a large number, 10\u2019s to 100\u2019s of capillaries that branch among the cells of the body. Capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit single red blood cells and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level. Fluid also leaks from the blood into the interstitial space from the capillaries. The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to.","related":true}

On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter. Furthermore, different protozoans have their own complex life cycles.

Whether those areas are close or very far apart, the signal must travel along an axon. The basis of the electrical signal is the controlled distribution of ions across the membrane. Transmembrane ion channels regulate when ions can move in or out of the cell, so that a precise signal is generated. This signal is the action potential which has a very characteristic shape based on voltage changes across the membrane in a given time period. The membrane is normally at rest with established Na+ and K+ concentrations on either side. A stimulus will start the depolarization of the membrane, and voltage-gated channels will result in further depolarization followed by repolarization of the membrane. A slight overshoot of hyperpolarization marks the end of the action potential. While an action potential is in progress, another cannot be generated under the same conditions. While the voltage-gated Na+ channel is inactivated, absolutely no action potentials can be generated. Once that channel has returned to its resting state, a new action potential is possible, but it must be started by a relatively stronger stimulus to overcome the K + leaving the cell. The action potential travels down the axon as voltage-gated ion channels are opened by the spreading depolarization. In unmyelinated axons, this happens in a continuous fashion because there are voltage-gated channels throughout the membrane. In myelinated axons, propagation is described as saltatory because voltage-gated channels are only found at the nodes of Ranvier and the electrical events seem to \u201cjump\u201d from one node to the next. Saltatory conduction is faster than continuous conduction, meaning that myelinated axons propagate their signals faster.

{"question":"Question: In response to high blood osmolarity, which can occur during dehydration or following a very salty meal, the osmoreceptors signal the posterior pituitary to release this?\n\nOptions:\nA. antidiuretic hormone (adh)\nB. adrenaline\nC. salt\nD. oxygen\n\nAnswer:","answer":"A","explanation":"Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) The solute concentration of the blood, or blood osmolarity, may change in response to the consumption of certain foods and fluids, as well as in response to disease, injury, medications, or other factors. Blood osmolarity is constantly monitored by osmoreceptors\u2014specialized cells within the hypothalamus that are particularly sensitive to the concentration of sodium ions and other solutes. In response to high blood osmolarity, which can occur during dehydration or following a very salty meal, the osmoreceptors signal the posterior pituitary to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The target cells of ADH are located in the tubular cells of the kidneys. Its effect is to increase epithelial permeability to water, allowing increased water reabsorption. The more water reabsorbed from the filtrate, the greater the amount of water that is returned to the blood and the less that is excreted in the urine. A greater concentration of water results in a reduced concentration of solutes. ADH is also known as vasopressin because, in very high concentrations, it causes constriction of blood vessels, which increases blood pressure by increasing peripheral resistance. The release of ADH is controlled by a negative feedback loop. As blood osmolarity decreases, the hypothalamic osmoreceptors sense the change and prompt a corresponding decrease in the secretion of ADH. As a result, less water is reabsorbed from the urine filtrate. Interestingly, drugs can affect the secretion of ADH. For example, alcohol consumption inhibits the release of ADH, resulting in increased urine production that can eventually lead to dehydration and a hangover. A disease called diabetes insipidus is characterized by chronic underproduction of ADH that causes chronic dehydration. Because little ADH is produced and secreted, not enough water is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Although patients feel thirsty, and increase their fluid consumption, this doesn\u2019t effectively decrease the solute concentration in their blood because ADH levels are not high enough to trigger water reabsorption in the kidneys. Electrolyte imbalances can occur in severe cases of diabetes insipidus.","related":true}

One of them is temperature (T). Perhaps one can vary the temperature of a gas sample and note what effect it has on the other properties of the gas. Early scientists did just this, discovering that if the amount of a gas and its pressure are kept constant, then changing the temperature changes the volume (V). As temperature increases, volume increases; as temperature decreases, volume decreases. We say that these two characteristics are directly related. A mathematical relationship between V and T should be possible except for one thought: what temperature scale should we use? We know from Chapter 2 \"Measurements\" that science uses several possible temperature scales. Experiments show that the volume of a gas is related to its absolute temperature in Kelvin, not its temperature in degrees Celsius. If the temperature of a gas is expressed in kelvins, then experiments show that the ratio of volume to temperature is a constant:.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: What nerves attached to the brain are mainly responsible for motor and sensory functions?\n\nOptions:\nA. autonomic nerves\nB. cranial nerves\nC. stimulation nerves\nD. somatic nerves\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"Cranial Nerves The nerves attached to the brain are the cranial nerves, which are primarily responsible for the sensory and motor functions of the head and neck (one of these nerves targets organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities as part of the parasympathetic nervous system). There are twelve cranial nerves, which are designated CNI through CNXII for \u201cCranial Nerve,\u201d using Roman numerals for 1 through 12. They can be classified as sensory nerves, motor nerves, or a combination of both, meaning that the axons in these nerves originate out of sensory ganglia external to the cranium or motor nuclei within the brain stem. Sensory axons enter the brain to synapse in a nucleus. Motor axons connect to skeletal muscles of the head or neck. Three of the nerves are solely composed of sensory fibers; five are strictly motor; and the remaining four are mixed nerves. Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses, and students have always used mnemonic devices to remember the nerve names. A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet, \u201cOn Old Olympus\u2019 Towering Tops\/A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops,\u201d in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each nerve. The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate naming. An exercise to help learn this sort of information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal significance. The names of the cranial nerves are listed in Table 13.3 along with a brief description of their function, their source (sensory ganglion or.","related":true}

We're asked for the MINIMUM possible value of (X)(Y).\nSince all of the answer choices are NEGATIVE, this tells us that ONE of the two variables MUST be negative (and the other must be positive), so we should restrict our work to those options.\nIF...\nX = 9, Y = -1, then XY = -9\nX = 8, Y = -2, then XY = -16\nX = 7, Y = -3, then XY = -21\nX = 6, Y = -4, then XY = -24\nX = 5, Y = -5, then XY = -25\nX = 4, Y = -6, then XY = -24\nX = 3, Y = -7, then XY = -21\nFrom this, we can conclude the XY will start to get bigger as X continues to decrease down to 1, so there's no need to do any additional work.\nFinal Answer:\nD","related":null}

{"question":"Question: What do fungi produce to digest nutrients?\n\nOptions:\nA. pores\nB. amino\nC. sporozoans\nD. exoenzymes\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"The ability of fungi to degrade many large and insoluble molecules is due to their mode of nutrition. As seen earlier, digestion precedes ingestion. Fungi produce a variety of exoenzymes to digest nutrients. The enzymes are either released into the substrate or remain bound to the outside of the fungal cell wall. Large molecules are broken down into small molecules, which are transported into the cell by a system of protein carriers embedded in the cell membrane. Because the movement of small molecules and enzymes is dependent on the presence of water, active growth depends on a relatively high percentage of moisture in the environment. As saprobes, fungi help maintain a sustainable ecosystem for the animals and plants that share the same habitat. In addition to replenishing the environment with nutrients, fungi interact directly with other organisms in beneficial, and sometimes damaging, ways (Figure 24.19).","related":true}

{"question":"Question: Dermal, vascular, and ground tissue make up what part of a plant, which bears the leaves, flowers and fruits?\n\nOptions:\nA. stem\nB. leaves\nC. root\nD. flowers\n\nAnswer:","answer":"A","explanation":"30.2 Stems The stem of a plant bears the leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are characterized by the presence of nodes (the points of attachment for leaves or branches) and internodes (regions between nodes). Plant organs are made up of simple and complex tissues. The stem has three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. Dermal tissue is the outer covering of the plant. It contains epidermal cells, stomata, guard cells, and trichomes. Vascular tissue is made up of xylem and phloem tissues and conducts water, minerals, and photosynthetic products. Ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis and support and is composed of parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells. Primary growth occurs at the tips of roots and shoots, causing an increase in length. Woody plants may also exhibit secondary growth, or increase in thickness. In woody plants, especially trees, annual rings may form as growth slows at the end of each season. Some plant species have modified stems that help to store food, propagate new plants, or discourage predators. Rhizomes, corms, stolons, runners, tubers, bulbs, tendrils, and thorns are examples of modified stems.","related":true}

The hormones epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) are released by the adrenal medulla. How do these hormones provide a burst of energy? Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver and skeletal muscles to break down glycogen and by stimulating glucose release by liver cells. Additionally, these hormones increase oxygen availability to cells by increasing the heart rate and dilating the bronchioles. The hormones also prioritize body function by increasing blood supply to essential organs such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles, while restricting blood flow to organs not in immediate need, such as the skin, digestive system, and kidneys. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are collectively called catecholamines.","related":true}

Plots of potential energy for a system versus the reaction coordinate show an energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to occur. The arrangement of atoms at the highest point of this barrier is the activated complex, or transition state, of the reaction. At a given temperature, the higher the Ea, the slower the reaction. The fraction of orientations that result in a reaction is the steric factor. The frequency factor, steric factor, and activation energy are related to the rate constant in the Arrhenius equation: \u00a0k = Ae - Ea \/ RT.

This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the compounds important for the body\u2019s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or organic. \u2022 An inorganic compound is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many inorganic compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H2O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl) produced by your stomach. In contrast, only a handful of inorganic compounds contain carbon atoms. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the few examples. \u2022 An organic compound, then, is a substance that contains both carbon and hydrogen. Organic compounds are synthesized via covalent bonds within living organisms, including the human body. Recall that carbon and hydrogen are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two elements combine in the foods you eat, in the compounds that make up your body structure, and in the chemicals that fuel your functioning.

Salt lakes and underground brines are even richer sources; for example, the Dead Sea contains 4 g of Br\u2212 per liter. Iodine is the least abundant of the nonradioactive halogens, and it is a relatively rare element. Because of its low electronegativity, iodine tends to occur in nature in an oxidized form. Hence most commercially important deposits of iodine, such as those in the Chilean desert, are iodate salts such as Ca(IO3)2. The production of iodine from such deposits therefore requires reduction rather than oxidation.

S Phase Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the S phase (synthesis phase), DNA replication results in the formation of two identical copies of each chromosome\u2014sister chromatids\u2014that are firmly attached at the centromere region. At this stage, each chromosome is made of two sister chromatids and is a duplicated chromosome. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. The centrosome consists of a pair of rod-like centrioles at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of many eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi. G2 Phase In the G2 phase, or second gap, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes the proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation. Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic spindle. There may be additional cell growth during G2. The final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the first stage of mitosis.","related":true}

In the early 1900s, a German neuroscientist named Korbinian Brodmann performed an extensive study of the microscopic anatomy\u2014the cytoarchitecture\u2014of the cerebral cortex and divided the cortex into 52 separate regions on the basis of the histology of the cortex. His work resulted in a system of classification known as Brodmann\u2019s areas, which is still used today to describe the anatomical distinctions within the cortex (Figure 13.8). The results from Brodmann\u2019s work on the anatomy align very well with the functional differences within the cortex. Areas 17 and 18 in the occipital lobe are responsible for primary visual perception. That visual information is complex, so it is processed in the temporal and parietal lobes as well. The temporal lobe is associated with primary auditory sensation, known as Brodmann\u2019s areas 41 and 42 in the superior temporal lobe. Because regions of the temporal lobe are part of the limbic system, memory is an important function associated with that lobe. Memory is essentially a sensory function; memories are recalled sensations such as the smell of Mom\u2019s baking or the sound of a barking dog. Even memories of movement are really the memory of sensory feedback from those movements, such as stretching muscles or the movement of the skin around a joint.

{"question":"Question: Internal and external forms of what life process occur as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient?\n\nOptions:\nA. photosynthesis\nB. respiration\nC. metabolism\nD. reproduction\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"Internal Respiration Internal respiration is gas exchange that occurs at the level of body tissues (Figure 22.23). Similar to external respiration, internal respiration also occurs as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient. However, the partial pressure gradients are opposite of those present at the respiratory membrane. The partial pressure of oxygen in tissues is low, about 40 mm Hg, because oxygen is continuously used for cellular respiration. In contrast, the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is about 100 mm Hg. This creates a pressure gradient that causes oxygen to dissociate from hemoglobin, diffuse out of the blood, cross the interstitial space, and enter the tissue. Hemoglobin that has little oxygen bound to it loses much of its brightness, so that blood returning to the heart is more burgundy in color. Considering that cellular respiration continuously produces carbon dioxide, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is lower in the blood than it is in the tissue, causing carbon dioxide to diffuse out of the tissue, cross the interstitial fluid, and enter the blood. It is then carried back to the lungs either bound to hemoglobin, dissolved in plasma, or in a converted form. By the time blood returns to the heart, the partial pressure of oxygen has returned to about 40 mm Hg, and the partial pressure.","related":true}

Antony rolls a die with 6 sides labeled with the integers from 1 to 6, each of which has an equal probability of landing face-up. He then takes 3^d, where d is the d-number of the result of his die roll, and plots 3^d on a number line as the point A. Finally, he repeats this entire process, this time plotting the result as the point B.

This result is the same for 2nd roll. 9, 81, 6561, 729, 9, 81.\nAbout distance: If the first result is 9 and the second is also 9, the distance is 9-9=0 which is smaller than 9. If the first result is 9 and the second is 81, the distance is 81-9=72 which is also smaller than B which has the value of 81.

In this case no other alternative values for second roll which would make the distance greater than B. So probability is 0. So next estimations are:\nprobability of getting 81 on the first roll (2\/6) * probability of getting 9 on the second roll (2\/6) = 1\/9\nprobability of getting 729 on the first roll (1\/6) * probability of getting 9, 81 on the second roll (4\/6) = 1\/9\nprobability of getting 6561 on the first roll (1\/6) * probability of getting 9, 81, 729 on the first roll (5\/6) = 5\/36\nAll together: 1\/9 + 1\/9 + 5\/36 = 13\/36=B","related":null}

Or we could find f(2), which would be 12 - 4\/2 = 10.\nSo the notation f(2k) means that we are going to plug a 2k in for x everywhere in the formula for f(x). That would be:\nf(2k) = 12 - (2k)^2\/2 = 12 - 2k^2.\nRemember that we have to square both the 2 and the k, to get 4k2.

It took the son 52.5 minutes to travel 3.75 km.

Since k<m<r<s<t, the median would be r.\nThe average of the positive integers is 16 which means that in effect, all numbers are equal to 16. If the largest number is 42, it is 26 more than 16. We need r to be maximum so k and m should be as small as possible to get the average of 16. Since all the numbers are positive integers, k and m cannot be less than 1 and 2 respectively. 1 is 15 less than 16 and 2 is 14 less than 16 which means k and m combined are 29 less than the average. 42 is already 26 more than 16 and hence we only have 29 - 26 = 3 extra to distribute between r and s. Since s must be greater than r, r can be 16+1 = 17 and s can be 16+2 = 18.\nSo r is 17.\nAnswer (A)","related":null}

A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 \u00b0C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point (Figure 10.35). Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical pressures of some common substances are given in Table 10.3. Substance.","related":true}

The normal boiling point of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding pressure is equal to 1 atm (101.3 kPa).

The bacteria get a place to live. Meanwhile, the bacteria help the herbivore digest food. Both species benefit, so this is a mutualistic relationship. The clownfish and the sea anemones also have a mutualistic relationship. The clownfish protects the anemone from anemone-eating fish, and the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from predators ( Figure below ). Another example of this type of symbiotic relationship is the relationship between the plover bird and the African crocodile. The tiny blackbird acts as a toothpick for the fierce crocodile, and helps by removing tiny morsels of food that are stuck between the crocodile's teeth. These food remains are the source of food for the bird. Another example is between the ostrich and the zebra. The ostrich always moves with the herd of zebras since it has a poor sense of hearing and smell, whereas the zebra has very sharp senses. The ostrich has a keen sense of sight, which the zebra lacks. Hence, these two species depend on each other to warn one another of any nearby imposing dangers.","related":true}

The amniotes include reptiles, birds, and mammals. The early amniotes diverged into two main lines soon after the first amniotes arose. The initial split was into synapsids (mammals) and sauropsids. Sauropsids can be further divided into anapsids (turtles) and diapsids (birds and reptiles). Reptiles are tetrapods either having four limbs or descending from such. Limbless reptiles (snakes) are classified as tetrapods, as they are descended from four-limbed organisms. One of the key adaptations that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of scaly skin containing the protein keratin, which prevented water loss from the skin. Reptilia includes four living clades: Crocodilia (crocodiles and alligators), Sphenodontia (tuataras), Squamata (lizards and snakes), and Testudines (turtles).","related":true}

{"question":"Question: Exemplified by cesium, which ignites spontaneously in air, pure elements with a high metallic character tend to be very what?\n\nOptions:\nA. radiactive\nB. inactive\nC. proactive\nD. reactive\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"Pure elements with a high metallic character, meaning those that have chemical properties most similar to properties of metals, are generally very reactive. Metals tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions, as indicated by their low ionization energies. Within a compound, metal atoms have a relatively low attraction to shared electrons, as indicated by their low electronegativity values. By following the trend summary in Figure below , you can see that the most reactive metals would reside in the lower left portion of the periodic table. The most reactive metal that occurs naturally in reasonable quantities is cesium, which is always found in nature as a compound, never as a free element. It reacts explosively with water and will ignite spontaneously in air. Francium is below cesium in the alkali metal group, but it is so rare that many of its properties have never even been observed.","related":true}

The body temperature of these organisms is generally similar to the temperature of the environment, although the individual organisms may do things that keep their bodies slightly below or above the environmental temperature. This can include burrowing underground on a hot day or resting in the sunlight on a cold day. The ectotherms have been called cold-blooded, a term that may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature. An animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called an endotherm.

Both the theory and the ideal gas law predict that gases compressed to very high pressures and cooled to very low temperatures should still behave like gases, albeit cold, dense ones. As gases are compressed and cooled, however, they invariably condense to form liquids, although very low temperatures are needed to liquefy light elements such as helium (for He, 4.2 K at 1 atm pressure). Liquefaction can be viewed as an extreme deviation from ideal gas behavior. It occurs when the molecules of a gas are cooled to the point where they no longer possess sufficient kinetic energy to overcome intermolecular attractive forces. The precise combination of temperature and pressure needed to liquefy a gas depends strongly on its molar mass and structure, with heavier and more complex molecules usually liquefying at higher temperatures. In general, substances with large van der Waals acoefficients are relatively easy to liquefy because large a coefficients indicate relatively strong intermolecular attractive interactions. Conversely, small molecules with only light elements have small a coefficients, indicating weak intermolecular interactions, and they are relatively difficult to liquefy. Gas liquefaction is used on a massive scale to separate O2, N2, Ar, Ne, Kr, and Xe. After a sample of air is liquefied, the mixture is.","related":true}

Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a \u201cnerve net. \u201d Echinoderms such as sea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers called nerves. Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a small \u201cbrain\u201d and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body. The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized. It contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia (clusters of connected neurons). These ganglia can control movements and behaviors without input from the brain.

But when you pour syrup on your pancakes, that liquid flows slowly and sticks to the pitcher. The difference is fluid friction, both within the fluid itself and between the fluid and its surroundings. We call this property of fluids viscosity. Juice has low viscosity, whereas syrup has high viscosity. In the previous sections we have considered ideal fluids with little or no viscosity. In this section, we will investigate what factors, including viscosity, affect the rate of fluid flow. The precise definition of viscosity is based on laminar, or nonturbulent, flow. Before we can define viscosity, then, we need to define laminar flow and turbulent flow. Figure 12.10 shows both types of flow.

{"question":"Question: The two lines y = x and x = -4 intersect on the coordinate plane. If z represents the area of the figure formed by the intersecting lines and the x-axis, what is the side length E of a cube whose surface area is equal to 6z?\n\nOptions:\nA)E=16\nB)E=8\u221a2\nC)E=8\nD)E=2\u221a2\nE)(\u221a2)\/3\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"800score Official Solution:\nThe first step to solving this problem is to actually graph the two lines. The lines intersect at the point (-4, -4) and form a right triangle whose base length and height are both equal to 4. As you know, the area of a triangle is equal to one half the product of its base length and height: A = (1\/2)bh = (1\/2)(4 \u00d7 4) = 8; so z = 8.\nThe next step requires us to find the length of a side of a cube that has a face area equal to 8. As you know the 6 faces of a cube are squares. So, we can reduce the problem to finding the length of the side of a square that has an area of 8. Since the area of a square is equal to s\u00b2, where s is the length of one of its side, we can write and solve the equation s\u00b2 = 8. Clearly s = \u221a8 = 2\u221a2 , oranswer choice (D).","related":null}

Absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular motion has ceased. The concept of absolute zero arises from the behavior of gases.

Various scientists have noted that the pressures of gases extrapolate to zero at the same temperature, \u2013273.15\u00baC . This extrapolation implies that there is a lowest temperature. This temperature is called absolute zero. Today we know that most gases first liquefy and then freeze, and it is not actually possible to reach absolute zero.

We are given a radiation scale, which can take 2 sets of samples and compare their added up radiation levels to tell us if the sums are the same or if different, which set has the higher level of radiation. What is the minimum number of comparisons we need on this scale to identify the counterfeit sample and to also determine whether it has more or less radiation than the other samples ?\n\nOptions:\nA)2\nB)3\nC)4\nD)5\nE)6\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"First of all if you are down to just 3 pieces and you know that if the offending piece is less or more active, then it takes exactly 1 measurement to find out the offending piece. So you know you have to reduce the problem to three.\nNow when you are down to either A or B after measurement 1, you need the next measurement to (a) reduce the problem set to 3 and (b) to know whether anser is more or less. Now you cannot compare a group of 4 to 4, as in the best case it will only reduce the problem to 4 elements which is not good enough.\nIf you have to choose a set of 3 to compare, you cannot pick any 3 on the same side from the same set (A or B) because if you do this, a quick check will show you that in every choice there is a case where you can only get down to 4 elements. Eg. If you weighed {1,2,3} v\/s {5,9,10} and they were equal you're problem would only reduce to {4,6,7,8}\nThe easiest way to solve this then is to compare 3 to 3, and make sure each side has elements from both AB such that whatever the measurement outcome in the worst case the problem reduces to 3 elements only. Which is why the sets {1,5,9} and {2,6,7} OR {A,B,C}{A,B,B}. The extra element from C is just taken to make the problem symmetric so to say, we have 8 elements and we make it 9, to compose 3 sets of 3 each.=B","related":null}

Magnetic force is always perpendicular to velocity, so that it does no work on the charged particle. The particle\u2019s kinetic energy and speed thus remain constant. The direction of motion is affected, but not the speed. This is typical of uniform circular motion. The simplest case occurs when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a uniform B -field, such as shown in Figure 22.20.

{"question":"Question: The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is known as genetic what?\n\nOptions:\nA. group\nB. variance\nC. variable\nD. density\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B","explanation":"Before Darwinian evolution became the prevailing theory of the field, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck theorized that acquired traits could, in fact, be inherited; while this hypothesis has largely been unsupported, scientists have recently begun to realize that Lamarck was not completely wrong. Visit this site (http:\/\/openstaxcollege. org\/l\/epigenetic) to learn more. Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences, or genetic variance, among individuals in a population. The greater the hereditability of a population\u2019s phenotypic variation, the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation. The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance. When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a population\u2019s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can. This also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding, the mating of closely related individuals, which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease. For example, a disease that is caused by a rare, recessive allele might exist in a population, but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele. Because the allele is rare in a normal, healthy population with unrestricted habitat, the chance that two carriers will mate is low, and even then, only 25 percent of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from both parents. While it is likely to happen at some point, it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population, and as a result, the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool. However, if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other, this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression. Changes in allele frequencies that are identified in a population can shed light on how it is evolving. In addition to natural selection, there are other evolutionary forces that could be in play: genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, nonrandom mating, and environmental variances.","related":true}

One of the fundamental quantities in science is temperature. Temperature is a measure of the average amount of energy of motion, or kinetic energy, a system contains. Temperatures are expressed using scales that use units called degrees, and there are several temperature scales in use. In the United States, the commonly used temperature scale is the Fahrenheit scale (symbolized by \u00b0F and spoken as \u201cdegrees Fahrenheit\u201d). On this scale, the freezing point of liquid water (the temperature at which liquid water turns to solid ice) is 32\u00b0F, and the boiling point of water (the temperature at which liquid water turns to steam) is 212\u00b0F. Science also uses other scales to express temperature. The Celsius scale (symbolized by \u00b0C and spoken as \u201cdegrees Celsius\u201d) is a temperature scale where 0\u00b0C is the freezing point of water and 100\u00b0C is the boiling point of water; the scale is divided into 100 divisions between these two landmarks and extended higher and lower. By comparing the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, a conversion between the two scales can be determined: \u00b0C=(\u00b0F\u201332)\u2009\u00d7\u200959\u00b0 Saylor URL: http:\/\/www. saylor. org\/books.","related":true}

The oldest rocks on Earth solidified about 3.5\u00d710 9 years ago\u2014a number determined by uranium-238 dating. These rocks could only have solidified once the surface of the Earth had cooled sufficiently. The temperature of the Earth at formation can be estimated based on gravitational potential energy of the assemblage of pieces being converted to thermal energy. Using heat transfer concepts discussed in Thermodynamics it is then possible to calculate how long it would take for the surface to cool to rock9 9 formation temperatures. The result is about 10 years. The first rocks formed have been solid for 3.5\u00d710 years, so that 9 the age of the Earth is approximately 4.5\u00d710 years. There is a large body of other types of evidence (both Earth-bound and solar system characteristics are used) that supports this age. The puzzle is that, given its age and initial temperature, the center of the Earth should be much cooler than it is today (see Figure 31.26).","related":true}

The lines intersect at the point (-2, -2) and form a right triangle whose base length and height are both equal to 4. As you know, the area of a triangle is equal to one half the product of its base length and height: A = (1\/2)bh = (1\/2)(2 \u00d7 2) = 2; so z = 2.\nThe next step requires us to find the length of a side of a cube that has a face area equal to 2. As you know the 6 faces of a cube are squares. So, we can reduce the problem to finding the length of the side of a square that has an area of 2. Since the area of a square is equal to s\u00b2, where s is the length of one of its side, we can write and solve the equation s\u00b2 = 2. Clearly s = \u221a2 , oranswer choice (D).","related":null}

{"question":"Question: What is the name of the process in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path?\n\nOptions:\nA. Different Process\nB. Remote process\nC. conductive process\nD. reversible process\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"Reversible Processes Both isothermal and adiabatic processes such as shown in Figure 15.13 are reversible in principle. A reversible process is one in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path. The reverse isothermal and adiabatic paths are BA and CA, respectively. Real macroscopic processes are never exactly reversible. In the previous examples, our system is a gas (like that in Figure 15.9), and its environment is the piston, cylinder, and the rest of the universe. If there are any energy-dissipating mechanisms, such as friction or turbulence, then heat transfer to the environment occurs for either direction of the piston. So, for example, if the path BA is followed and there is friction, then the gas will be returned to its original state but the environment will not\u2014it will have been heated in both directions. Reversibility requires the direction of heat transfer to reverse for the reverse path. Since dissipative mechanisms cannot be completely eliminated, real processes cannot be reversible. There must be reasons that real macroscopic processes cannot be reversible. We can imagine them going in reverse. For example, heat transfer occurs spontaneously from hot to cold and never spontaneously the reverse. Yet it would not violate the first law of thermodynamics for this to happen. In fact, all spontaneous processes, such as bubbles bursting, never go in reverse. There is a second thermodynamic law that forbids them from going in reverse. When we study this law, we will learn something about nature and also find that such a law limits the efficiency of heat engines. We will find that heat engines with the greatest possible theoretical efficiency would have to use reversible processes, and even they cannot convert all heat transfer into doing work. Table 15.2 summarizes the simpler thermodynamic processes and their definitions.","related":true}

One such method is a titration, in which a measured volume of a solution of one substance, the titrant, is added to a solution of another substance to determine its concentration. The equivalence point in a titration is the point at which exactly enough reactant has been added for the reaction to go to completion. A standard solution, a solution whose concentration is known precisely, is used to determine the concentration of the titrant.

The point at which a color change is observed is the endpoint, which is close to the equivalence point if the indicator is chosen properly.","related":true}

Therefore, there will be 12 litres of milk in the mixture and 8 litres of water in the mixture.\nStep 1.\nWhen 10 litres of the mixture is removed, 6 litres of milk is removed and 4 litres of water is removed. Therefore, there will be 6 litres of milk and 4 litres of water left in the container. It is then replaced with pure milk of 10 litres. Now the container will have 16 litres of milk and 4 litres of water.\nStep 2.\nWhen 10 litres of the new mixture is removed, 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water is removed. The container will have 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it. Now 10 litres of pure milk is added. Therefore, the container will have 18 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it at the end of the second step. Therefore, the ratio of milk and water is 18 : 2 or 9 : 1.\nShortcut.\nWe are essentially replacing water in the mixture with pure milk.\nLet W_o be the amount of water in the mixture originally = 8 litres.\nLet W_r be the amount of water in the mixture after the replacements have taken place.\nThen,{W_r}\/{W_o}= (1-R\/M)^n\nwhere R is the amount of the mixture replaced by milk in each of the steps, M is the total volume of the mixture and n is the number of times the cycle is repeated.\nHence, {W_r}\/{W_o}\u00a0=(1\/2)^2\u00a0 =1\/4\nTherefore,TW_r\u00a0={W_o}\/4= 8\/4\u00a0= 2 litres.B","related":null}

(1 cubic meter = 1,000 liters)\nIn other words, the tank is going to have a volume of 1000 cubic meters. That would equal 1 million liters.\nA cube with a volume of 1000 cubic meters must be (10 meters) x (10 meters) x (10 meters).\nThe question doesn't specify whether this tank should have a closed top or an open top. (The real GMAT is good about specifying things like that.) Here, we are going to assume a closed top, only because if the top is open, we don't use enough metal --- we get an answer smaller than any of the answer choices. A closed-top cube, a full cube, has 6 sides, each of which is (10 meters) x (10 meters).

{"question":"Question: Which organisms capture light energy and convert it to chemical energy inside their cell?\n\nOptions:\nA. pores\nB. sporozoans\nC. chloroplasts\nD. phototrophs\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"Phototrophs are organisms that capture light energy and convert it to chemical energy inside their cell. Most phototrophs are the autotrophs that perform photosynthesis, which are also known as photoautotrophs. These organisms have the ability to fix carbon from carbon dioxide into organic compounds, such as glucose. Chemotrophs , on the other hand, do not get their energy from carbon. These are organisms that break down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell through chemosynthesis. Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic (chemoautotrophs) or heterotrophic (chemoheterotrophs). Chemoautotrophs derive their energy from chemical reactions, and synthesize all necessary organic compounds from carbon dioxide. Chemoheterotrophs are unable to fix carbon to form their own organic compounds. The various types of metabolisms are discussed in the Prokaryotes: Nutrition and Metabolism (Advanced) concept.","related":true}

{"question":"Question: What are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membranebound nuclei?\n\nOptions:\nA. prokaryotes\nB. arthropods\nC. eukaryotes\nD. viruses\n\nAnswer:","answer":"A","explanation":"Watch this video (http:\/\/openstaxcollege. org\/l\/rotating_DNA) that animates the three-dimensional structure of the DNA molecule shown in Figure 1.15. Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called organelles. Organelles are small structures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable functions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars. All living things are made of cells; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce. ) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Prokaryotes are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membranebound nuclei; in contrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus. In larger organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions.

Since k<m<r<s<t, the median would be r.\nThe average of the positive integers is 16 which means that in effect, all numbers are equal to 16. If the largest number is 30, it is 14 more than 16. We need r to be maximum so k and m should be as small as possible to get the average of 16. Since all the numbers are positive integers, k and m cannot be less than 1 and 2 respectively. 1 is 15 less than 16 and 2 is 14 less than 16 which means k and m combined are 29 less than the average. 30 is already 14 more than 16 and hence we only have 29 - 14 =15 extra to distribute between r and s.

{"question":"Question: Labor is the muscular contractions to expel the fetus and placenta from where?\n\nOptions:\nA. lungs\nB. anus\nC. uterus\nD. tumors\n\nAnswer:","answer":"C","explanation":"Visit this website (http:\/\/openstaxcollege. org\/l\/embryo_fetus2) to see the stages of human fetal development. Labor is the muscular contractions to expel the fetus and placenta from the uterus. Toward the end of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin. At this time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening). This causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin causes smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells are recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force. There are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the baby and placenta to be expelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage two, the baby is expelled from the uterus. The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall. If labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as Pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain labor.","related":true}

Think about the question this way: we know that there is a total of 5 to be spread among the 4 digits, we just have to determine the number of ways it can be spread.\nLet X represent a sum of 1, and | represent a separator between two digits. As a result, we will have 5 X's (digits add up to the 5), and 3 |'s (3 digit separators).\nSo, for example:\nXX|X|X|X = 2111\n||XXX|XX = 0032\netc.\nThere are 8C3 ways to determine where to place the separators.

In Nebraska, this mouse is typically brown. But in places where glaciers dropped lighter sand over the darker soil, the mice are light. Why? Because predators could more easily spot the dark mice on light sand. The lighter mice were more likely to survive and have offspring. Natural selection favored the light mice.

{"question":"Question: How do dogs lose body heat?\n\nOptions:\nA. sweating\nB. eating\nC. barking\nD. panting\n\nAnswer:","answer":"D","explanation":"One way mammals lose excess heat is by increasing blood flow to the skin. This warms the skin so heat can be given off to the environment. That\u2019s why you may get flushed, or red in the face, when you exercise on a hot day. You are likely to sweat as well. Sweating also reduces body heat. Sweat wets the skin, and when it evaporates, it cools the body. Evaporation uses energy, and the energy comes from body heat. Animals with fur, such as dogs, use panting instead of sweating to lose body heat (see Figure below ). Evaporation of water from the tongue and other moist surfaces of the mouth and throat uses heat and helps cool the body.","related":true}

If half of the journeymen were laid off, what percentage of the total remaining employees would be journeymen?\n\nOptions:\nA) 14.3%\nB) 16.67%\nC) 33%\nD) 28.6%\nE) 49.67%\n\nAnswer:","answer":"C","explanation":"The exam gives us a number that is easily divisible by 7 to pique our curiosity and tempt us into calculating actual numbers (also because otherwise the ratio would be incorrect). Since the question is about percentages, the actual numbers will be meaningless, as only the ratio of that number versus others will be meaningful. Nonetheless, for those who are curious, each 1\/7 portion represents (14210\/7) 2,030 employees. This in turn means that 4,060 employees are journeymen and the remaining 10,150 are full time workers.\nIf half the journeymen were laid off, that would mean 1\/7 of the total current workforce would be removed. This statistic is what leads many students to think that since half the journeymen are left, the remaining journeymen would represent half of what they used to be, which means 1\/7 of the total workforce. If 1\/7 of the workforce is journeymen, and 1\/7 is roughly 14.3%, then answer choice A should be the right answer. In this case, though, it is merely the tempting trap answer choice.\nWhat changed between the initial statement and the final tally? Well, you let go of 1\/7 of the workforce, so the total number of workers went down. The remaining workers are still 1\/7 of the initial workers, but the group has changed. The new workforce is smaller than the original group, specifically 6\/7 of it because 1\/7 was eliminated. The remaining workers now account for 1\/7 out of 6\/7 of the force, which if we multiply by 7 gives us 1 out of 6. This number as a percentage is answer choice B, 33%.\nUsing the absolute numbers we calculated before, there were 4,060 journeymen employees out of 14,210 total. If 2,030 of them are laid off, then there are 2,030 journeyman employees left, but now out of a total of (14,210-2,030) 12,180 employees. 2,030\/12,180 is exactly 1\/6, or 16.67%. The answer will work with either percentages or absolute numbers, but the percentage calculation will be significantly faster and applicable to any similar situation.\nThe underlying principle of percentages (and, on a related note, ratios) can be summed up in the brainteaser I like to ask my students: If you\u2019re running a race and you overtake the 2nd place runner just before the end, what position do you end up in?\nThe correct answer is 2nd place.\nPercentages, like ratios and other concepts of relative math, depend entirely on the context. Whether 100% more of something is better than 50% more of something else depends on the context much more than the percentages quoted. When it comes to percentages on the GMAT, the goal is to understand them enough to instinctively not fall into the traps laid out for you.C","related":null}
